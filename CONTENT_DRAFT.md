5. ✅ Developer has deep domain expertise (25+ years, federal background)

**What it protects:**
1. ✅ Doesn't reveal specific features/implementation
2. ✅ No detailed workflow descriptions
3. ✅ No mention of specific AI capabilities
4. ✅ No screenshots or demos
5. ✅ Positions as "coming soon" not "available now"
