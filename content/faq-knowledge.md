## Features & Capabilities

**What can I do with Nquir?**

1. **Structured Workflow**: Guide your team through proven methodologies with built-in quality controls and checkpoints

2. **Evidence Organization**: Secure document management with proper access controls, chain of custody, and complete audit trails

3. **AI-Assisted Analysis**: Leverage AI to identify patterns, flag gaps in evidence, and accelerate review—while maintaining full control over findings

4. **Semantic Evidence Search**: Unlike keyword search, Nquir understands meaning. It finds relevant passages across all your documents even when exact words don't match. Every piece of evidence gets a relevance score (0.0-1.0) so you can measure your coverage.

5. **Team Collaboration**: Role-based access, shared workspaces, and coordinated workflows for multi-person engagements

6. **Professional Documentation**: Generate properly structured reports with evidence citations and compliance-ready formatting

**How does the AI-assisted analysis work?**
When you run analysis on a question, Nquir searches your entire evidence collection—every document, transcript, and note—to find passages that are conceptually relevant to what you're asking. The AI considers all your evidence, not just what you manually linked. Every finding includes citations showing exactly which evidence supports each point.

**What makes Nquir's search different?**
Traditional search finds documents with your keywords. Nquir understands what you're asking and finds relevant passages even when the words don't match. For example, if you search for "overtime violations," Nquir will also find passages about "pressured to stay past my shift" because they're semantically related.
