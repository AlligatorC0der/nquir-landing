**Who built Nquir?**
Nquir was developed by an experienced federal oversight professional and healthcare provider with over 25 years conducting high-stakes inquiries across government and healthcare settings. The founder has deep federal compliance expertise and has been a product owner for multiple software solutions deployed across federal agencies.

## Features & Capabilities

**What can I do with Nquir?**

1. **Structured Workflow**: Guide your team through proven methodologies with built-in quality controls and checkpoints

2. **Evidence Organization**: Secure document management with proper access controls, chain of custody, and complete audit trails

3. **AI-Assisted Analysis**: Leverage AI to identify patterns, flag gaps in evidence, and accelerate review—while maintaining full control over findings

4. **Semantic Evidence Search**: Unlike keyword search, Nquir understands meaning. It finds relevant passages across all your documents even when exact words don't match. Every piece of evidence gets a relevance score (0.0-1.0) so you can measure your coverage.

5. **Team Collaboration**: Role-based access, shared workspaces, and coordinated workflows for multi-person engagements

6. **Professional Documentation**: Generate properly structured reports with evidence citations and compliance-ready formatting

**How does the AI-assisted analysis work?**
When you run analysis on a question, Nquir searches your entire evidence collection—every document, transcript, and note—to find passages that are conceptually relevant to what you're asking. The AI considers all your evidence, not just what you manually linked. Every finding includes citations showing exactly which evidence supports each point.

**What makes Nquir's search different?**
Traditional search finds documents with your keywords. Nquir understands what you're asking and finds relevant passages even when the words don't match. For example, if you search for "overtime violations," Nquir will also find passages about "pressured to stay past my shift" because they're semantically related.

**Does the AI replace human judgment?**
No. Nquir's AI assists and accelerates your work, but you maintain full control. The AI helps identify patterns, flag potential gaps, and surface relevant evidence—but all findings and conclusions remain yours to review, edit, and finalize.

**How accurate is the AI analysis?**
Nquir provides transparency tools so you can evaluate AI output:
- Quality metrics showing faithfulness to evidence
- Relevance scores for retrieved passages
- Citations linking every claim to source evidence
- The ability to review and edit all AI-generated content

## Evidence Evaluation Framework

**How does Nquir evaluate evidence?**
Nquir uses a formal evidence evaluation framework based on cross-sector professional standards. Every piece of evidence is assessed against ten quality criteria used in oversight, audit, compliance, and investigative work.

**What are the ten quality criteria?**
1. **Relevance** - Does the evidence connect to the question being examined?
2. **Reliability** - Is the source trustworthy and free from bias?
3. **Sufficiency** - Is there enough evidence to support a conclusion?
4. **Validity** - Does this evidence actually prove what it's offered to prove?
5. **Competence** - Is the source qualified? Was evidence properly collected?
6. **Completeness** - Does the evidence cover the matter thoroughly?
7. **Timeliness** - Was the evidence created at an appropriate time?
8. **Objectivity** - Is this fact-based or opinion-based?
9. **Authenticity** - Is this evidence genuine and verifiable?
10. **Consistency** - Does this align with other evidence?

**Why does this matter?**
This creates a documented reasoning chain that you can verify. The AI doesn't just summarize—it systematically applies professional standards and explicitly states which criteria each piece of evidence satisfies.

## Quality Metrics & Transparency

**What quality metrics does Nquir provide?**
Nquir includes three automated quality checks for every AI analysis:

1. **Faithfulness Score** - Are claims in the analysis actually supported by your evidence? A separate process examines each factual claim and checks for evidence support.

2. **Coverage Score** - Does the analysis address all parts of your question? The system breaks your question into elements and checks if each is addressed.

3. **Retrieval Quality** - How relevant was the evidence found? Indicates whether the AI had strong, reasonable, or limited evidence to work with.

**What do the confidence levels mean?**
- **Established**: Strong, sufficient, convergent evidence
- **Probable**: Good evidence with minor gaps
- **Possible**: Some evidence but significant gaps
- **Insufficient**: Evidence too weak or incomplete to conclude
- **Contradicted**: Evidence weighs against this conclusion

---

## AI Limitations

**What can't the AI do?**
Being clear about limitations is important:

- **Does not make determinations** - The AI provides analysis; you make findings
- **Does not access external information** - Only works with evidence you've uploaded
- **Does not guarantee accuracy** - Quality checks catch many issues, but verification is essential
- **Does not provide legal advice** - Consult qualified counsel for legal matters
- **Does not replace professional skills** - Cannot assess witness credibility, conduct interviews, or exercise discretion

**What happens with very large evidence sets?**
The AI can process substantial amounts of text, but for very large collections the most relevant evidence is prioritized. Quality metrics indicate when limitations may affect analysis.

**Is my data used to train AI models?**
No. Your inquiry data is processed to generate your analysis but is never used to train or improve AI models
